## Overview
This mod aims to add a avenue to gain several artifacts through a unique decision.

The player will have the option to fund an expedition to Old Valyria and pick an individual from their court to search for long lost artifacts in Old Valyria.

The adventurer can recover a number of Valyrian artifacts, such as unhatched dragon eggs, ancient Valyrian glass candles, and a wide assortment of Valyrian Steel Weaponry.

These expeditions are not without danger however. An explorer may return severely injured, or afflicted with a dangerous disease...or they may not return at all.
